## To start the app
1. Download the repository
`git clone http://genentech-vbadmd@git.codesubmit.io/genentech/todo-app-vue-beczns`

2. Install JSON Server
`npm install json-server`

3. Install dependencies
`npm install`

4. Start the server
`npm run dev`

5. Start the front end
`npm run serve`

6. Run the tests
`npm run test:unit`

### Objective

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

Using Vue on the front-end and JS or Python on the back-end, your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. 

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Genentech Team
